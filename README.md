## Project Name
Circuits Escape Room

## Project  Description
Circuits Escape Room is an innovative study tool designed for the Computer and Electrical Engineering department. Tailored for the Circuits course, this interactive platform merges educational content with engaging gameplay. Users navigate through an escape room setting where they encounter trivia questions related to circuits coursework. Correct answers advance players toward 'escaping' the room, fostering learning through gamified challenges that enhance understanding of circuit basics.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Download our repository as a .zip file. Open Godot and select the import and install option. Then select the .zip file you just downloaded and Godot should load the project. Once all the files are loaded, press the play button (triangle pointing right), which is on the top right corner in Godot, and the game should begin.

## Usage
Use WASD or arrow keys to control your character in this platformer game. Walk up to any of the Puzzles and use E to interact to start working on the puzzle question. Answer all the puzzle questions correctly to open the exit door and escape the room!

## Roadmap
Ideas for future could be adding new levels, and possibly even releasing it on itch.io for easier access to the study tool game.
